# State tracking, timers, patrol variables, player reference, chase distances

# TODO: Add new variables for attack behavior  
# Look at "Attack Timing and Cooldowns" documentation
# You need: attack distance, attack damage, attack timing variables

# Print current state, distance to player, attack timers, etc.
